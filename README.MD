You'll find different tabs in this spreadsheet.
-  <b>Tabular Data Tab </b><br />
This will give all the data in a tabular format. It includes individual responses, their country, city and state as well as how they feel about the policy, categoriezed in column 'answer' as bad, good or neutral. The individual IDs and IP addresses have been removed in order to maintain anonymity of responses.

This tab shows the number of responses received distributed by country. More than 95% of the responses were received from the United states.

-  <b>Answer Distribution tab </b><br />
This tab shows the overall feeling about the policy, categorized as bad, good and neutral.

-  <b>Distribution by US states tab </b><br />
This tab gives color coded distrbution of overall feeling about this policy within United states but by individual states.
